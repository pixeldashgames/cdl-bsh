true and false features:
As result of our code, each command put its output in a file, so we treat true and false like echo 0 and echo 1 respectively. For us, 0 is true and 1 is false
; && || features:
For these operators we reuse the way in which we execute the multiple pipes but this time we dont change the counter value (for more understanding execute "help multi-pipe" command) and declare that this command do not recive inputs
After executing each operator we check if the previous output of the command (0 or 1) and decide whether to execute the next command depending on its behavior
